Landing page to practice CSS

## Reflection
It was satisfying to build a page that looks decent, at least on my screen. There is still a lot that I have to learn about setting it up for multiple screen sizes. I also felt like the project was cobbled together.  I definitely need more practice, but this was a helpful project to get some reps with the basic CSS properties.
